<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University, and I am studying Information Technology. 
<br>
<br>
Although I still am searching for a regular church, I have visited Hampton Park Baptist Church these last few weeks. Sometime in the next month, I will begin participating in outreaches to nursing homes in the Greenville area.
<br>
<br>
As for hobbies, I enjoy hanging out with friends, video games, and volleyball. In highschool volleyball, our team won state for three years in a row, and I look forward to seeing them do it again. </p>
